# Summary

Navigate to repository URL.

# Motivation

Most of the time one would need quick acess to the repository of a module.

# Detailed design

`yarn home <module_name>` must open the default browser and navigate to the repository URL mentioned in the `package.json`

If there isn't any URL mentioned in the `package.json` of the module under the interest, just return to the prompt.

# How We Teach This

Just educate them with the new command `yarn home` or `yarn docs`.

# Drawbacks

None.

# Alternatives

We must also check if the user is offline or not.

# Unresolved questions

None as of now.
